<!-- CSS positioning -->

.item{
    position: static / relative / absolute / fixed     (static is the default)
}

Relative:     
    moves relative to current position 
    does not break the flow of the static items
    content moves but space where it occupied is left 
    
Absolute: 
    moves relative to either, fulo body of page OR parent, if parent is set to relative
    space where is orgionally occupied is filled by other elements
    
For moving content around it is better to use Absolute
